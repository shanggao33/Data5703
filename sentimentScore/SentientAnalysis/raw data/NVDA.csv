199867,421383,NVDA,Qualcomm sees more China trouble  faces probes in U S   Europe,news,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Qualcomm Inc  O QCOM  warned on Wednesday that an antitrust investigation and problems collecting royalties could harm its business in China next year and it also disclosed new regulatory investigations in the United States and Europe 
China s expanding high speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading edge technology  but Qualcomm s opportunities have been clouded by an 11 month old antitrust investigation there 
Wall Street is worried  Qualcomm could face a fine of more than  1 billion in China as a result of the National Development and Reform Commission  NDRC  investigation  and the company could be forced to make concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging royalties on phones that use its patents 
Qualcomm also said it faces a new probe by the European Commission about rebates and other financial incentives in the sale of its chips  Another preliminary investigation by the U S  Federal Trade Commission concerns a potential breach of licensing terms  the company said 
On Wednesday  Qualcomm s shares slid about 6 percent at  72 50 in extended trading from a  77 20 close on the Nasdaq 
 We re continuing to cooperate with the NDRC  We ve continued to meet with them regularly  exchange some ideas for potential ways to resolve it   Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in a telephone interview   But we don t have an ability to update in terms of expectations and timing  
Qualcomm has also been struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China  including local manufacturers the U S  chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past 
Any concessions on royalties that Qualcomm is forced to make in China could spread to manufacturers in other countries  some investors said 
 What people are most worried about is the ability to fence in this issue to Chinese vendors if there s a reduced royalty rate  or does it spread to other geographies   Standard Life portfolio manager Brian Fox said 
Qualcomm said it was difficult to predict the outcome of the U S  and European investigations 
The European probe is separate from a four year old complaint to the European Commission from a subsidiary of Nvidia Corp  O NVDA  over alleged patent related incentives and exclusionary pricing by Qualcomm 
Qualcomm forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 of between  26 8 billion and  28 8 billion  Analysts on average expected  28 91 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
The company also expects non GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2015 to be between  5 05 and  5 35  Analysts on average expected  5 58 
The chipmaker reported revenue of  6 69 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter  ended Sept  28  up 3 percent from the year ago period  Analysts on average had expected  7 016 billion 

Qualcomm posted fourth quarter net income of  1 89 billion  up 26 percent from a year ago  GAAP earnings per share were  1 11  while non GAAP earnings were  1 26 per share

 NEW YORK  Aug 11  Reuters    U S  stocks shot up 4 percent
 on Thursday as bargain hungry investors overcame the recent
wave of fear that drove selling over the last two weeks 
 Thursday s rally marked the second bounce in a yo yo week 
After a sell off that pushed the S P 500 down as much as 17
percent since July 22  the market is showing some signs of
regaining its footing 
  It s a bungee cord market  We ve fallen off of a small
bridge  the bungee cord bounced us up  and oscillations will
diminish  but we re stil bouncing around   said Fred Dickson 
chief market strategist at D A  Davidson   Co   in Lake

 Investors used results from Cisco  and a slight
dip in weekly U S  jobless claims as the catalyst to snap up
beaten down stocks  Worries about the spread of the European
debt crisis were also somewhat alleviated after news of a
meeting between France s Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany s Angela
Merkel set for Tuesday 
 Financials outpaced other S P 500 sectors after leading
losses in the previous session  But bank borrowing costs were
under some pressure overseas  For details  see

 SOME SIGNS POINT DOWN
 While the major indexes showed strong gains on Thursday 
the S P 500 has fallen for 11 of the past 14 sessions 
 Analysts said they still awaited a bottom in the
correction that has taken the S P 500 down 14 percent from its
April 29 closing high 
 The trend is downward now  We re having a big up day  but
it s been very volatile  We ve been up against resistance for
a little while in the 1 170 level in the S P 500     our next
level I believe is 1 188   said Stephen J Guilfoyle  U S 
economist for Meridian Equity Partners and institutional sales
trader on the NYSE floor 
 One sign the market s downturn may not be over is a
measure of stocks with 52 week highs versus 52 week lows 
according to Bruce Zaro  chief technical strategist at Delta
Global Asset Management in Boston 
  Some days need to pass before that indicator reverses  
which would then suggest a bottom  he said

 NEW YORK  Aug 12  Reuters    U S  futures were higher on
Friday  signaling stocks would extend the previous day s big
gains  after a rally in Europe and another strong outlook from
a technology company 
 Major indexes soared 4 percent on Thursday as valuations
became attractive enough to entice buyers following a wave of
fear that brought the S P 500 near bear market territory 
 It was the fourth day in a row the S P ended with a move of
more than 4 percent  and the index has fallen for 11 of the
past 14 days 
 European shares gained early Friday  rising 2 3 percent

 For investors  concerns over slowing U S  growth and fiscal
problems on both sides of the Atlantic have mattered more than
an earnings season in which a majority of companies topped
profit and revenue expectations 
  The more companies that are positive about how they might
do over the next six months  the more confidence investors will
have that the price they re paying for stocks is fair   said
Rick Meckler  president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in New York 
  Having companies project solid sales in the coming year
will be a big part of this market moving back forward  
 S P 500 futures  rose 5 8 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  added 72
points and Nasdaq 100 futures  rose 6 25 points

 NEW YORK  Aug 12  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Friday as
mildly encouraging retail sales overshadowed weak consumer
sentiment data  with lighter volume reflecting a drop in
investor anxiety 
 Still  the market was down for the week and on track for
its worst three week decline since March of 2009  when it hit
12 year lows 
 Trading remained volatile  with stocks retreating after the
sentiment reading early in the session  then rebounding by
midday 
 With less than two hours of trading left  composite volume
was about 6 billion shares  far below the daily average of
approximately 16 billion shares traded this week 
  Today s slowdown in volume is clearly indicative of people
getting a little bit more comfortable about where the market
is   said Ken Polcari  managing director at ICAP Equities in
New York   It continues to be a little bit jumpy  but  the S P
is  holding between 1 117 and 1 170  
 He said if next week s economic data meet expectations  the
current trading range could continue 
  Before moving higher the market needs to do some repair
work and needs to build a base  and that s what we re doing

 NEW YORK  Aug 12  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Friday as
mildly encouraging retail sales overshadowed weak consumer
sentiment data  with lighter volume reflecting a drop in
investor anxiety 
 Still  the market was down for the week and on track for
its worst three week decline since March of 2009  when it hit
12 year lows 
 Trading remained volatile  with stocks retreating after the
sentiment reading early in the session  then rebounding by
midday 
 With less than two hours of trading left  composite volume
was about 6 billion shares  far below the daily average of
approximately 16 billion shares traded this week 
  Today s slowdown in volume is clearly indicative of people
getting a little bit more comfortable about where the market
is   said Ken Polcari  managing director at ICAP Equities in
New York   It continues to be a little bit jumpy  but  the S P
is  holding between 1 117 and 1 170  
 He said if next week s economic data meet expectations  the
current trading range could continue 
  Before moving higher the market needs to do some repair
work and needs to build a base  and that s what we re doing
right now   Polcari said
